Auto close spotify after a given time

Hello there!
Ever wanted to sleep with music on but Spotify desktop won't let you because it'll keep playing the whole time?

This application lets you close Spotify desktop after a given duration of time of your choice.
Just enter the duration in number of minutes and you're set.
Spotify will be closed after the time elapses. 

Have a good sleep!
